## Introduction



Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features. In this lecture, we will learn how to perform decision tree analysis in R, including model building, evaluation, and visualization.



## Key Concepts



### 1. What is a Decision Tree?



A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a feature (or attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.



### 2. Advantages and Disadvantages



**Advantages:**

- Easy to understand and interpret.

- Requires little data preprocessing.

- Can handle both numerical and categorical data.



**Disadvantages:**

- Prone to overfitting.

- Can be unstable with small changes in data.

- May require pruning to improve generalization.



## Performing Decision Tree Analysis in R



### 1. Installing Required Packages



We will use the `rpart` package for building decision trees and the `rpart.plot` package for visualization.



```r

# Installing required packages

install.packages("rpart")

install.packages("rpart.plot")

```



### 2. Building the Model



You can build a decision tree model using the `rpart()` function.



```r

# Loading the required packages

library(rpart)

library(rpart.plot)



# Creating a sample dataset

set.seed(123)

data <- data.frame(

  x1 = rnorm(100),

  x2 = rnorm(100),

  y = factor(sample(c("A", "B"), 100, replace = TRUE))

)



# Splitting the data into training and testing sets

library(caret)

trainIndex <- createDataPartition(data$y, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)

train_data <- data[trainIndex, ]

test_data <- data[-trainIndex, ]



# Building the decision tree model

model <- rpart(y ~ x1 + x2, data = train_data, method = "class")

print(model)

```



### 3. Visualizing the Tree



You can visualize the decision tree using the `rpart.plot()` function.



```r

# Plotting the decision tree

rpart.plot(model, main = "Decision Tree")

```



### 4. Making Predictions



You can use the model to make predictions on new data.



```r

# Making predictions on the test set

predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data, type = "class")



# Confusion Matrix

confusion_matrix <- table(predictions, test_data$y)

print(confusion_matrix)



# Calculating accuracy

accuracy <- sum(diag(confusion_matrix)) / sum(confusion_matrix)

print(paste("Accuracy:", accuracy))

```



## Example: Comprehensive Decision Tree Analysis



Here's a comprehensive example of performing decision tree analysis in R.



```r

# Creating a sample dataset

set.seed(123)

data <- data.frame(

  x1 = rnorm(100),

  x2 = rnorm(100),

  y = factor(sample(c("A", "B"), 100, replace = TRUE))

)



# Splitting the data into training and testing sets

library(caret)

trainIndex <- createDataPartition(data$y, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)

train_data <- data[trainIndex, ]

test_data <- data[-trainIndex, ]



# Building the decision tree model

library(rpart)

library(rpart.plot)

model <- rpart(y ~ x1 + x2, data = train_data, method = "class")



# Visualizing the tree

rpart.plot(model, main = "Decision Tree")



# Making predictions on the test set

predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data, type = "class")



# Evaluating the model

confusion_matrix <- table(predictions, test_data$y)

accuracy <- sum(diag(confusion_matrix)) / sum(confusion_matrix)

print(paste("Accuracy:", accuracy))

```



## Summary



In this lecture, we covered how to perform decision tree analysis in R, including building the model, evaluating its performance, making predictions, and visualizing the results. Decision trees are a powerful tool for both classification and regression tasks, offering a clear and interpretable model structure.
