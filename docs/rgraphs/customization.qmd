## Introduction



Customizing plots is essential for enhancing their appearance and readability. R provides a wide range of options for customizing plots, including adding titles, labels, legends, colors, and annotations. In this lecture, we will learn various techniques for customizing plots in R.



## Key Concepts



### 1. Adding Titles and Labels



Adding titles and labels helps in understanding the context and meaning of the plot.



### 2. Customizing Colors and Symbols



Customizing colors and symbols can differentiate between groups or highlight specific data points.



### 3. Adding Legends



Adding legends helps in identifying the categories or groups in the plot.



### 4. Adding Gridlines



Adding gridlines can make it easier to read the values of the data points.



### 5. Adding Annotations



Adding annotations can provide additional information about specific data points or regions in the plot.



## Customizing Plots in R



### 1. Adding Titles and Labels



You can add titles and labels to a plot using the `main`, `xlab`, and `ylab` parameters in the `plot()` function.



```{r echo=TRUE}

# Creating sample data

x <- rnorm(100)

y <- rnorm(100)



# Adding titles and labels

plot(x, y, main = "Scatter Plot with Titles and Labels", xlab = "X Axis Label", ylab = "Y Axis Label", pch = 19, col = "blue")

```




### 2. Customizing Colors and Symbols



You can customize colors and symbols using the `col` and `pch` parameters in the `plot()` function.



```{r echo=TRUE}

# Creating sample data with groups

group <- sample(c("Group 1", "Group 2"), 100, replace = TRUE)
color_map <- c("Group 1" = "blue", "Group 2" = "red")



# Customizing colors and symbols

plot(x, y, 
     main = "Scatter Plot with Custom Colors and Symbols", 
     xlab = "X Axis", 
     ylab = "Y Axis",      
     pch = as.numeric(factor(group)),  # Convert groups to numbers
     col = color_map[group])  # Map colors to groups


legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Group 1", "Group 2"), 
       pch = c(1, 2), 
       col = c("black", "red"))

```





### 3. Adding Legends



You can add legends to a plot using the `legend()` function.



```{r echo=TRUE}

# Creating sample data with groups

group <- sample(c("Group 1", "Group 2"), 100, replace = TRUE)
color_map <- c("Group 1" = "blue", "Group 2" = "red")



# Adding legends

plot(x, y, 
     main = "Scatter Plot with Legends", 
     xlab = "X Axis", 
     ylab = "Y Axis", 
     pch = as.numeric(factor(group)),  # Convert groups to numbers
     col = color_map[group])  # Map colors to groups

legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Group 1", "Group 2"), 
       pch = c(1, 2), 
       col = c("black", "red"))

```






### 4. Adding Gridlines



You can add gridlines to a plot using the `grid()` function.



```{r echo=TRUE}

# Adding gridlines

plot(x, y, main = "Scatter Plot with Gridlines", xlab = "X Axis", ylab = "Y Axis", pch = 19, col = "blue")

grid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = "lightgray", lty = "dotted")

```






### 5. Adding Annotations



You can add annotations to a plot using the `text()` and `arrows()` functions.



```{r echo=TRUE}

# Adding annotations

plot(x, y, main = "Scatter Plot with Annotations", xlab = "X Axis", ylab = "Y Axis", pch = 19, col = "blue")

text(x[1:5], y[1:5], labels = paste("Point", 1:5), pos = 4)

arrows(x[1:5], y[1:5], x[1:5] + 0.5, y[1:5] + 0.5, length = 0.1, angle = 20, col = "red")

```






## Example: Comprehensive Plot Customization



Here's a comprehensive example of customizing plots in R.



```{r echo=TRUE}

# Creating sample data

x <- rnorm(100)

y <- rnorm(100)

group <- sample(c("Group 1", "Group 2"), 100, replace = TRUE)

# Create a color map
color_map <- c("Group 1" = "black", "Group 2" = "red")



# Adding titles and labels

plot(x, y, 
     main = "Comprehensive Plot Customization", 
     xlab = "X Axis", 
     ylab = "Y Axis", 
     pch = as.numeric(factor(group)),  # Convert groups to numbers for point shapes
     col = color_map[group])  # Map colors to groups



# Adding legends

legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Group 1", "Group 2"), 
       pch = c(1, 2), 
       col = c("black", "red"))



# Adding gridlines

grid(nx = NULL, ny = NULL, col = "lightgray", lty = "dotted")



# Adding annotations

text(x[1:5], y[1:5], labels = paste("Point", 1:5), pos = 4)

arrows(x[1:5], y[1:5], x[1:5] + 0.5, y[1:5] + 0.5, length = 0.1, angle = 20, col = "red")

```



## Summary



In this lecture, we covered how to customize plots in R. We explored various techniques for adding titles, labels, colors, symbols, legends, gridlines, and annotations.
