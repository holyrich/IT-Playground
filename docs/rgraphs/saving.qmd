## Introduction



Saving plots is an important aspect of data visualization, allowing you to share your work, include plots in reports or presentations, and preserve your visualizations for future use. In this lecture, we will learn how to save plots created in R to various file formats.



## Key Concepts



### 1. File Formats



R supports saving plots to several file formats, including:

- **PNG**: Portable Network Graphics

- **JPEG**: Joint Photographic Experts Group

- **PDF**: Portable Document Format

- **SVG**: Scalable Vector Graphics



### 2. Functions for Saving Plots



R provides several functions for saving plots to different file formats:

- `png()`: Save a plot as a PNG file.

- `jpeg()`: Save a plot as a JPEG file.

- `pdf()`: Save a plot as a PDF file.

- `svg()`: Save a plot as an SVG file.

- `ggsave()`: Save a ggplot2 plot to a file.



## Saving Plots in R



### 1. Saving Base R Plots



#### Saving as PNG



```r

# Creating a sample plot

plot(rnorm(100), main = "Sample Plot")



# Saving the plot as a PNG file

png("sample_plot.png")

plot(rnorm(100), main = "Sample Plot")

dev.off()

```



#### Saving as JPEG



```r

# Saving the plot as a JPEG file

jpeg("sample_plot.jpg")

plot(rnorm(100), main = "Sample Plot")

dev.off()

```



#### Saving as PDF



```r

# Saving the plot as a PDF file

pdf("sample_plot.pdf")

plot(rnorm(100), main = "Sample Plot")

dev.off()

```



#### Saving as SVG



```r

# Saving the plot as an SVG file

svg("sample_plot.svg")

plot(rnorm(100), main = "Sample Plot")

dev.off()

```



### 2. Saving ggplot2 Plots



The `ggsave()` function is specifically designed for saving ggplot2 plots and can save to various file formats.



```r

# Installing and loading ggplot2

install.packages("ggplot2")

library(ggplot2)



# Creating a sample ggplot2 plot

p <- ggplot(data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100)), aes(x = x, y = y)) +

  geom_point() +

  labs(title = "Sample ggplot2 Plot")



# Saving the plot using ggsave()

ggsave("sample_ggplot2_plot.png", plot = p)

ggsave("sample_ggplot2_plot.pdf", plot = p)

```



### 3. Customizing Plot Size and Resolution



You can customize the size and resolution of the saved plot using the `width`, `height`, and `dpi` parameters in the `ggsave()` function.



```r

# Saving the plot with custom size and resolution

ggsave("sample_ggplot2_plot_custom.png", plot = p, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)

```



### 4. Example: Comprehensive Plot Saving



Here's a comprehensive example of saving plots in R.



```r

# Creating a sample base R plot

plot(rnorm(100), main = "Sample Base R Plot")



# Saving the base R plot as a PNG file

png("sample_base_plot.png")

plot(rnorm(100), main = "Sample Base R Plot")

dev.off()



# Saving the base R plot as a JPEG file

jpeg("sample_base_plot.jpg")

plot(rnorm(100), main = "Sample Base R Plot")

dev.off()



# Saving the base R plot as a PDF file

pdf("sample_base_plot.pdf")

plot(rnorm(100), main = "Sample Base R Plot")

dev.off()



# Saving the base R plot as an SVG file

svg("sample_base_plot.svg")

plot(rnorm(100), main = "Sample Base R Plot")

dev.off()



# Creating a sample ggplot2 plot

p <- ggplot(data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100)), aes(x = x, y = y)) +

  geom_point() +

  labs(title = "Sample ggplot2 Plot")



# Saving the ggplot2 plot using ggsave()

ggsave("sample_ggplot2_plot.png", plot = p)

ggsave("sample_ggplot2_plot.pdf", plot = p)



# Saving the ggplot2 plot with custom size and resolution

ggsave("sample_ggplot2_plot_custom.png", plot = p, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)

```



## Summary



In this lecture, we covered how to save plots created in R to various file formats. We explored several functions for saving plots, including `png()`, `jpeg()`, `pdf()`, `svg()`, and `ggsave()`. We also learned how to customize the size and resolution of the saved plots.
