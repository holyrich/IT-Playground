## Introduction



Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this lecture, we will learn how to perform linear regression in R, including model building, evaluation, and interpretation.



## Key Concepts



### 1. What is Linear Regression?



Linear regression aims to find the best-fitting straight line through the data points that predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variables. The equation of a simple linear regression line is:



\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \]



where:

- \( y \) is the dependent variable.

- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept.

- \( \beta_1 \) is the slope.

- \( x \) is the independent variable.

- \( \epsilon \) is the error term.



### 2. Assumptions of Linear Regression



For linear regression to provide reliable results, the following assumptions must be met:

- Linearity: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear.

- Independence: Observations are independent of each other.

- Homoscedasticity: The residuals have constant variance at all levels of the independent variable.

- Normality: The residuals are normally distributed.



## Performing Linear Regression in R



### 1. Building the Model



You can build a linear regression model using the `lm()` function in R.



```r

# Creating a sample dataset

set.seed(123)

data <- data.frame(

  x = rnorm(100),

  y = 3 * rnorm(100) + 2 * rnorm(100) + rnorm(100)

)



# Building the linear regression model

model <- lm(y ~ x, data = data)

summary(model)

```



### 2. Evaluating the Model



You can evaluate the model's performance using various metrics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and residual standard error.



```r

# Model summary

summary(model)

```



### 3. Making Predictions



You can use the model to make predictions on new data.



```r

# Creating new data for prediction

new_data <- data.frame(x = c(-1, 0, 1))



# Making predictions

predictions <- predict(model, newdata = new_data)

print(predictions)

```



### 4. Plotting the Regression Line



You can visualize the regression line along with the data points using the `ggplot2` package.



```r

# Installing and loading ggplot2

install.packages("ggplot2")

library(ggplot2)



# Plotting the regression line

ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +

  geom_point() +

  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "red") +

  labs(title = "Linear Regression", x = "Independent Variable (x)", y = "Dependent Variable (y)")

```



## Example: Comprehensive Linear Regression Analysis



Here's a comprehensive example of performing linear regression analysis in R.



```r

# Creating a sample dataset

set.seed(123)

data <- data.frame(

  x = rnorm(100),

  y = 3 * rnorm(100) + 2 * rnorm(100) + rnorm(100)

)



# Splitting the data into training and testing sets

library(caret)

trainIndex <- createDataPartition(data$y, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)

train_data <- data[trainIndex, ]

test_data <- data[-trainIndex, ]



# Building the linear regression model

model <- lm(y ~ x, data = train_data)



# Evaluating the model

summary(model)



# Making predictions on the test set

predictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)



# Calculating Mean Squared Error

mse <- mean((test_data$y - predictions)^2)

print(paste("Mean Squared Error:", mse))



# Plotting the regression line

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(train_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +

  geom_point() +

  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "red") +

  labs(title = "Linear Regression", x = "Independent Variable (x)", y = "Dependent Variable (y)")

```



## Summary



In this lecture, we covered how to perform linear regression in R, including building the model, evaluating its performance, making predictions, and visualizing the results. Linear regression is a powerful tool for understanding relationships between variables and making predictions based on those relationships.
