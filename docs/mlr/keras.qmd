## Introduction

Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the human brain, capable of capturing complex patterns in data. Keras is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models, providing a simple and user-friendly interface. In this lecture, we will learn how to build and train neural networks using the Keras package in R.

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is Keras?

Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python and R interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library. It is designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks.

### 2. Neural Network Structure

A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). The primary types of layers are:

- **Input Layer**: The layer that receives the input data.
- **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that perform computations and extract features.
- **Output Layer**: The layer that produces the final prediction or classification.

## Performing Neural Network Analysis in R with Keras

### 1. Installing Required Packages

We will use the `keras` package for building neural networks.

```r
# Installing the keras package
install.packages("keras")
library(keras)

# Installing TensorFlow backend
install_keras()
```

### 2. Preparing the Data

We will use the MNIST dataset, a popular dataset for image classification tasks.

```r
# Loading the MNIST dataset
mnist <- dataset_mnist()
x_train <- mnist$train$x
y_train <- mnist$train$y
x_test <- mnist$test$x
y_test <- mnist$test$y

# Reshaping and scaling the data
x_train <- array_reshape(x_train, c(nrow(x_train), 784))
x_test <- array_reshape(x_test, c(nrow(x_test), 784))
x_train <- x_train / 255
x_test <- x_test / 255

# Converting labels to categorical
y_train <- to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test <- to_categorical(y_test, 10)
```

### 3. Building the Model

You can build a neural network model using the `keras_model_sequential()` function.

```r
# Building the neural network model
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu', input_shape = 784) %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')

# Printing the model summary
summary(model)
```

### 4. Compiling the Model

Compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and metrics.

```r
# Compiling the model
model %>% compile(
  loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
  optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)
```

### 5. Training the Model

Train the model using the `fit()` function.

```r
# Training the model
history <- model %>% fit(
  x_train, y_train,
  epochs = 30,
  batch_size = 128,
  validation_split = 0.2
)
```

### 6. Evaluating the Model

Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.

```r
# Evaluating the model
score <- model %>% evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(score)
```

### 7. Making Predictions

Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

```r
# Making predictions
predictions <- model %>% predict_classes(x_test)
print(predictions)
```

## Example: Comprehensive Neural Network Analysis

Here's a comprehensive example of building, training, and evaluating a neural network using the Keras package in R.

```r
# Loading the keras package
library(keras)

# Loading the MNIST dataset
mnist <- dataset_mnist()
x_train <- mnist$train$x
y_train <- mnist$train$y
x_test <- mnist$test$x
y_test <- mnist$test$y

# Reshaping and scaling the data
x_train <- array_reshape(x_train, c(nrow(x_train), 784))
x_test <- array_reshape(x_test, c(nrow(x_test), 784))
x_train <- x_train / 255
x_test <- x_test / 255

# Converting labels to categorical
y_train <- to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test <- to_categorical(y_test, 10)

# Building the neural network model
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu', input_shape = 784) %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')

# Printing the model summary
summary(model)

# Compiling the model
model %>% compile(
  loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
  optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)

# Training the model
history <- model %>% fit(
  x_train, y_train,
  epochs = 30,
  batch_size = 128,
  validation_split = 0.2
)

# Evaluating the model
score <- model %>% evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(score)

# Making predictions
predictions <- model %>% predict_classes(x_test)
print(predictions)
```
