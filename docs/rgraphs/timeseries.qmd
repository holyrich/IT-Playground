## Introduction



Time series plots are a powerful tool for visualizing data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. They are essential for understanding trends, patterns, and seasonal variations in time series data. In this lecture, we will learn how to create and customize time series plots in R.



## Key Concepts



### 1. What is a Time Series Plot?



A time series plot displays data points at successive time intervals. It helps in identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies over time.



### 2. Applications of Time Series Plots



- Analyzing trends over time.

- Identifying seasonal patterns.

- Detecting anomalies and outliers.



## Creating and Customizing Time Series Plots in R



### 1. Basic Time Series Plot with Base R



You can create a basic time series plot using the `plot()` function in base R.



```{r echo=TRUE}

# Creating sample time series data

set.seed(123)

time_series_data <- ts(rnorm(100), start = c(2020, 1), frequency = 12)



# Creating a basic time series plot

plot(time_series_data, main = "Basic Time Series Plot", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Value")

```




### 2. Time Series Plot with ggplot2



The `ggplot2` package provides more flexibility and customization options for creating time series plots.



```r

# Installing and loading ggplot2

install.packages("ggplot2")
```
```{r echo=TRUE}


library(ggplot2)



# Converting time series data to a data frame

time_series_df <- data.frame(

  Time = time(time_series_data),

  Value = as.numeric(time_series_data)

)



# Creating a time series plot with ggplot2

ggplot(time_series_df, aes(x = Time, y = Value)) +

  geom_line() +

  labs(title = "Time Series Plot with ggplot2", x = "Time", y = "Value")

```




### 3. Adding Trend Lines



You can add trend lines to a time series plot to highlight the overall trend.



```r

# Adding a trend line

ggplot(time_series_df, aes(x = Time, y = Value)) +

  geom_line() +

  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "red") +

  labs(title = "Time Series Plot with Trend Line", x = "Time", y = "Value")

```



```{r}

# Plot result

ggplot(time_series_df, aes(x = Time, y = Value)) +

  geom_line() +

  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "red") +

  labs(title = "Time Series Plot with Trend Line", x = "Time", y = "Value")

```



### 4. Customizing the Plot



You can customize the appearance of the time series plot by adjusting colors, labels, and themes.



```r

# Customizing the time series plot

ggplot(time_series_df, aes(x = Time, y = Value)) +

  geom_line(col = "blue") +

  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "red") +

  labs(title = "Customized Time Series Plot", x = "Time", y = "Value") +

  theme_minimal()

```



```{r}

# Plot result

ggplot(time_series_df, aes(x = Time, y = Value)) +

  geom_line(col = "blue") +

  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "red") +

  labs(title = "Customized Time Series Plot", x = "Time", y = "Value") +

  theme_minimal()

```



### 5. Handling Multiple Time Series



You can plot multiple time series in a single plot to compare different datasets.



```{r echo=TRUE}

# Creating sample data for multiple time series

time_series_data2 <- ts(rnorm(100, mean = 0.5), start = c(2020, 1), frequency = 12)

time_series_df2 <- data.frame(

  Time = time(time_series_data),

  Value1 = as.numeric(time_series_data),

  Value2 = as.numeric(time_series_data2)

)



# Melting the data frame for ggplot2

library(reshape2)

time_series_df2_melt <- melt(time_series_df2, id.vars = "Time")



# Plotting multiple time series

ggplot(time_series_df2_melt, aes(x = Time, y = value, color = variable)) +

  geom_line() +

  labs(title = "Multiple Time Series Plot", x = "Time", y = "Value", color = "Series") +

  theme_minimal()

```



```{r}

# Plot result

time_series_data2 <- ts(rnorm(100, mean = 0.5), start = c(2020, 1), frequency = 12)

time_series_df2 <- data.frame(

  Time = time(time_series_data),

  Value1 = as.numeric(time_series_data),

  Value2 = as.numeric(time_series_data2)

)



time_series_df2_melt <- melt(time_series_df2, id.vars = "Time")



ggplot(time_series_df2_melt, aes(x = Time, y = value, color = variable)) +

  geom_line() +

  labs(title = "Multiple Time Series Plot", x = "Time", y = "Value", color = "Series") +

  theme_minimal()

```
