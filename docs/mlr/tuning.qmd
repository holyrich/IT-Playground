## Introduction



Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal hyperparameters for a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but set prior to the training process. Proper tuning can significantly improve the performance of a model. In this lecture, we will learn how to perform hyperparameter tuning in R, including grid search and random search techniques.



## Key Concepts



### 1. What are Hyperparameters?



Hyperparameters are the parameters of a model that are set before the learning process begins. Examples include the learning rate, the number of trees in a random forest, and the penalty parameter in a support vector machine. These are different from model parameters, which are learned during training.



### 2. Importance of Hyperparameter Tuning



Proper hyperparameter tuning is crucial because it can:

- Improve model performance.

- Prevent overfitting.

- Ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.



## Performing Hyperparameter Tuning in R



### 1. Installing Required Packages



We will use the `caret` package for hyperparameter tuning.



```r

# Installing the caret package

install.packages("caret")

```



### 2. Grid Search



Grid search is a systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning that evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters specified in a grid.



```r

# Loading the required package

library(caret)



# Creating a sample dataset

set.seed(123)

data <- data.frame(

  x1 = rnorm(100),

  x2 = rnorm(100),

  y = factor(sample(c("A", "B"), 100, replace = TRUE))

)



# Defining the training control

train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)



# Defining the grid of hyperparameters

grid <- expand.grid(C = c(0.1, 1, 10), sigma = c(0.01, 0.1, 1))



# Training the model using grid search

model <- train(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data, method = "svmRadial",

               trControl = train_control, tuneGrid = grid)

print(model)

```



### 3. Random Search



Random search is an alternative to grid search that randomly samples hyperparameters from specified distributions.



```r

# Defining the training control for random search

train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5, search = "random")



# Training the model using random search

model <- train(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data, method = "svmRadial",

               trControl = train_control, tuneLength = 10)

print(model)

```



## Example: Comprehensive Hyperparameter Tuning



Here's a comprehensive example of performing hyperparameter tuning in R using grid search and random search.



```r

# Loading the required package

library(caret)



# Creating a sample dataset

set.seed(123)

data <- data.frame(

  x1 = rnorm(100),

  x2 = rnorm(100),

  y = factor(sample(c("A", "B"), 100, replace = TRUE))

)



# Grid Search

# Defining the training control

train_control_grid <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)



# Defining the grid of hyperparameters

grid <- expand.grid(C = c(0.1, 1, 10), sigma = c(0.01, 0.1, 1))



# Training the model using grid search

model_grid <- train(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data, method = "svmRadial",

                    trControl = train_control_grid, tuneGrid = grid)

print(model_grid)



# Random Search

# Defining the training control for random search

train_control_random <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5, search = "random")



# Training the model using random search

model_random <- train(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data, method = "svmRadial",

                      trControl = train_control_random, tuneLength = 10)

print(model_random)

```
